# Fast Feasts

In my experience with hospitality, sometimes groups of working clients only have limited time for lunch breaks. they would email their orders to us with a time and date for the order to be ready for.

This project allows users to browse a menu, make an order, add extra patrons to the table and allow any meal to have cooking instructions attached to that meal

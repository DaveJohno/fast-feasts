# Fast Feasts

In my experience with hospitality, sometimes groups of working clients only have limited time for lunch breaks. they would email their orders to us with a time and date for the order to be ready for.

This project allows users to browse a menu, make an order, add extra patrons to the table and allow any meal to have cooking instructions attached to that meal

## MY Plan

day one

- get sign up and login working
- get log out working

day Two

- food orders db
- create, edit and delete the order
- create, edit and delete any meal on an order

## Cool Tech

## Lessons i learned

## Features to add
